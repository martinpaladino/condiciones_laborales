# 0. About our research
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### Mixed methodologies

- Quantitative analysis of official data at national level.
    - Triangulation of Economic Census and National Survey of Micro Businesses.
- Qualitative fieldwork.
    - Quick ethnography: interviews and observation. 
    - Bottom-up recruitment of informants to control selection bias. 
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# 1. Landscape
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 1.1. Economic units are getting **smaller**

- **Problems for large factories.**
    - Periodic recessions hit the industry.
    - Payments by retailers are slow to come.
- Small workshops have greater flexibility and take up workers and equipment.
    - Small (up to 20 workers) and with obsolete machinery.
    - Often run by former workers.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 1.2. Supply chain is complex

- **Many layers of outsourcing.**
    - Tracing orders or pieces gets harder.
- **Formal/informal distinction isn't a clear cut.**
    - Both for production and commercialization.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### 1.3. From a workers point of view:

üëé Low productivity, long working ours.

üëç Close relationship between workers and owners. 
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# 2. Working conditions <br> Key findings
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 2.1. Remunerations

- The garment industry pays about the same as other labour intensive / low capital industries in Mexico. 

- And within the expectations of low skill workers in local labor markets. 

- Payment delays and arbitrary discounts are a recurrent issue. 

> Wages are not the main source of discomfort of workers.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 2.2. Working time

- Working days are long, often over 10 hours.
    - Much longer if includes transportation times. 

- Exit time is unknown beforehand, as depends on the orders that have to be finished. 
    - Poor production planing in small and medium factories.

- Poor work/life balance comes up a top source of discomfort among workers. 
    - Specially for women who take care of their families/children.

> Implicit way to reduce payments.
>
> Visible part of deeper problems: low productivity, poor planning. 
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 2.3. Mental demands

- Verbal abuse and arbitrary discipline measures come up in interviews 
    - Mostly in past tense
    - At the beginning of their careers
    - In large(ish) workshops
    - Carried out by both management and co-workers

- Situation gets better in small workshops. 
    - Closer relationship with owners. 
    - Sorority in *all female* workshops.  
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 2.4. Collective action

The legal framework (Ley General del Trabajo) allows free representation and organization of labour. 

- Yet, in practice, are nonexistent. 
    - We couldn't find a single case of a free union during fieldwork. 
- There's not a updated and accurate public record of unions.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
### 2.4.1. Why? 

**Small workshops:** a minimum of 20 workers is required for a production unit to organize.

- Workers in small workshops default to a branch union a rarely know who are their representatives.

**Large factories:** *sindicatos de protecci√≥n* are the norm, not the exception.

- Registering a new union is almost impossible.  

**Local political incumbents** reluctant to accept a new type of actor. 

> Practical, more than legal barriers to real representation.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# 2.5. Gender dynamics

- No significant remunerations gap.

- Women career path are bumpier. (pregnancy, maternity)

- For women, working under a female boss is taken in high regard. 
    - More affinity in the workspace. 
    - Sympathetic to their situation regarding children & family care.

# 3. Recommendations
</script></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# 3.1. Transparency & workers empowerment
</script></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 3.1.1. Lower the barrier for union registration

- Lobby to change the regulations to make easier formally registering a new union.

- Make registering in a public registry of unions a requisite.

## Create a public registry of unions. 

- Work with allies to make that registry easily accessible on line.
- Create a buyers code which includes labor representation as criteria for selecting suppliers.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 3.1.2. Key benefits

- Responsible brands will have a clear reference for purchase decisions.
    - Positive feed-back loop: rewards factories and workshops with proper workers representation.
- Better environment for bottom-up union creation.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 3.1.3. Limitations

- No feedback loop for the informal sector.
- Workers in domestic production units remain hard to reach.
</script></section></section><section ><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
# 3.2. Promote informal labor organizations

- Short of promoting unions right away.
- Should have less opposition from entrenched local incumbents.
- Will create basic social capital among workers. <br> *(Trust and a social ties)*
- C&A Foundation partners with experience and expertise in this kind of initiatives.
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 3.2.1. Key benefits

- Allows workers to make most of the opportunities given by the eased environment for formal union registration. 

- Lowers the barrier for new workers to get the practical know how for dealing with the management.

> Experiences in other industries are promising.
</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template">
## 3.3. Research agenda for work in domestic units

- There's little knowledge of the relative size to the industry, working conditions and retail channels for products made in household workshops. 

- Third party testimonies point to:

    - Children labour.
    - Poor physical conditions.

- The levers to operate on this sector are unknown. </script></section></div>
